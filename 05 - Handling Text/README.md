# 05 - Handling Text

In this lab we will go through an amusing slidedeck by [Xanda Schofield](http://www.cs.cornell.edu/~xanda/) on [Practical text mining](http://www.cs.cornell.edu/courses/cs4300/2016sp/Slides/Lecture16.pdf).
As a reference for other text-related tasks, you can check the slides of the [Stanford NLP course](https://web.stanford.edu/~jurafsky/NLPCourseraSlides.html).
